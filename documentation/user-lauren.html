<h1>Persona: Lauren Douglass</h1>

<p>As a large dog owner I would like to know where my dog can have the most open space to run around when we play fetch, as well as knowing the best places for her to socialize with other dogs.</p>

    <li>Series 7 apple watch</li>
    <li>Macbook Air running iOS Monterey</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2>Attitudes and Needs</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Apartment complex she lives in only has a small dog area for play and potty-time.</li>
    <li>Needs more open space for her large dog to stretch its legs.</li>
    <li>Recently moved to ABQ and is unfamiliar with the area.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frustrations</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Very busy with work so any free time must be planned out in advanced</li>
    <li>Last time Sara went to a dog park there were no other dogs for Furball to play with</li>
    <li>Likes to use Yelp but wishes there was more of a community feeling to interact with other dog owners</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interaction Flow</h2>
<p>I registered my dog, Furball on the Dog Park Community app and got to upload a photo of him with his name. This process was very easy to set up, I was only asked for my email address & password setup, dog’s name, and dog’s photo. Upon landing on the homepage I saw a list of dog parks in the city of Albuquerque to choose from, once I found the park closest to my home I was able to view “doggy check ins” where other users can check in via the app to either the big dog or small dog side. I was excited to see 3 small dogs were currently at the park which allows me to be sure that Furball will have friends to interact with when we arrive.
</p>

<h2>Post User Experience</h2>
<p>With Dog Park app I was able to find a park with a great reputation amongst the community, Furball was able to play with other small dogs, and now I really look forward to using this app for future park visits since Furball loves making new friends! I was also able to upload photos of Furball at the park for the community to see.</p>
