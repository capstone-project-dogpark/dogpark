<h2>Interaction Flow</h2>
<p>User was referred to the dog park community app by a co-worker. Created a profile for her Great Dane, Belle, on the Dog Park Community app and got to upload a photo her and her name. This process was very standard like other social medias but for dogs. User was only asked for my email address & password setup, dog’s name, and dog’s photo. Upon landing on the homepage User sees a list of dog parks in the city of Albuquerque to choose from. Once User found a park that was the closest big dog park to her home she was able to view other “doggy check ins” and see where other users can check in via the app for either the big dog or small dog side of the park. User was impressed with the size of the open area and amount of other big dogs playing on the field.
