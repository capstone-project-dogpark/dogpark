<h2>Post User Experience</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Carl wants to make friends within his community. He's really picky about where he posts pictures of his dogs because he doesn't want to fill up his media with dog pictures. His friends told him about a website where you can upload all the dog photos you want within the community. After making a profile and exploring around, Carl found an option to share dogs photos, and proceeded to add a photo of his choice to share with others.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2>Post-condition</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Carl has completed uploading a photo of his dog and is waiting to see how the community responds. Throughout the process, he had a pleasant experience with a simple task that anyone can perform.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interaction Flow</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Carl is on the main website of the dog community website and he sees a tab to share photos. He proceeds to click on the tab.</li>
    <li>The website redirects him to another page.</li>
    <li>As he surveys the website, he notices the upload file and clicks on it</li>
    <li>There is now a pop-up window that appears, giving him an option to look for the photo that he would like to share.</li>
    <li>In the folder files and he presses on the open button to share the photo.</li>
    <li>The pop-up disappears</li>

    <li>As he clicks on the comment tab, he is given a field box to type in his quote.</li>
    <li>Once he types in his quote in the comment field box, he proceeds to click on the share tab.</li>
    <li>The website redirects him back to the main page.</li>
    <li>He notices that the image he shared appears in a feed in the left side of the window following the most recent sharing photo.</li>
