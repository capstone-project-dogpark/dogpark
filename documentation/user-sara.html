<h1>Persona: Sara Jones</h1>

<h2>User Story</h2>
<p>As a dog owner, I would like to socialize online with other dog owners in my community.</p>

<h2>Technology</h2>
<ul>

  <li>Apple watch</li>
  <li>iMac desktop running iOS Monterey</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proficiency</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Loves the convenience of technology but is not glued to it and finds time to disconnect.</li>
  <li>Main apps: Instagram, Facebook, Yelp and Amazon.</li>
  <li>Uses a computer all day at work, mostly Microsoft Office and Google Documents.</li>
  <li>Facebook is her favorite app to communicate with family & friends.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Attitudes and Needs</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Loves her dog and would like to have more doggy play dates</li>
  <li>Wants to be sure she takes her dog to a safe/clean park</li>
  <li>Would like to be able to ask for animal care recommendations or setup play-dates with other owners online.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frustrations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Very busy with work so any free time must be planned out in advanced</li>
  <li>Last time Sara went to a dog park there were no other dogs for Furball to play with</li>
  <li>Likes to use Yelp but wishes there was more of a community feeling to interact with other dog owners</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interaction Flow</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I went to the Dog Park Community site and clicked on "create a pet profile"</li>
  <li>The site took me to a page where I provided information needed.</li>
  <li>I used the input form to provide my email address, created a password, my dog's name, uploaded a photo of Furball, and clicked "submit"</li>
  <li>The site then took me to my profile page where I can see Furball's profile photo, I see a section where I can create photo posts, I can also see my default dog park which I selected while registering, and below that are two other buttons, one for "my friends" and "make new friends" </li>
  <li>I clicked on "make new friends"</li>
  <li>The site took me to a page where I am able to view other doggy profiles, I followed a few cute dogs profiles and I am now able to comment and chat with other owners in the area.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Post User Experience</h2>
<p>With Dog Park app I was able to find a way to interact with local dog owners and share doggy care ideas as well as schedule play dates for Furball.</p>
