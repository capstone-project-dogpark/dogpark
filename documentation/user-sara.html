<h1>Persona: Sara Jones</h1>

  <li>iPhone 14 running iOS 16</li>
  <li>Apple watch</li>
  <li>iMac desktop running iOS Monterey</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proficiency</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Loves the convenience of technology but is not glued to it and finds time to disconnect.</li>
  <li>Main apps: Instagram, Facebook, Yelp and Amazon.</li>
  <li>Uses a computer all day at work, mostly Microsoft Office and Google Documents.</li>
  <li>Facebook is her favorite app to communicate with family & friends.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Attitudes and Needs</h2>

  <li>Wants to be sure she takes her dog to a safe/clean park</li>
  <li>Will drive to a park further from her house if the ratings are better</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frustrations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Very busy with work so any free time must be planned out in advanced</li>
  <li>Last time Sara went to a dog park there were no other dogs for Furball to play with</li>
  <li>Likes to use Yelp but wishes there was more of a community feeling to interact with other dog owners</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interaction Flow</h2>
<p>I registered my dog, Furball on the Dog Park Community app and got to upload a photo of him with his name. This process was very easy to set up, I was only asked for my email address & password setup, dog’s name, and dog’s photo. Upon landing on the homepage I saw a list of dog parks in the city of Albuquerque to choose from, once I found the park closest to my home I was able to view “doggy check ins” where other users can check in via the app to either the big dog or small dog side. I was excited to see 3 small dogs were currently at the park which allows me to be sure that Furball will have friends to interact with when we arrive.
</p>

<h2>Post User Experience</h2>
<p>With Dog Park app I was able to find a park with a great reputation amongst the community, Furball was able to play with other small dogs, and now I really look forward to using this app for future park visits since Furball loves making new friends! I was also able to upload photos of Furball at the park for the community to see.</p>
